## I'm a multi-disciplinary engineering designer with robust technical skills, and I'm known for getting the job done right the first time.  

Most recently, I've served as Senior Electrical Designer, responsible for lighting and power design for commercial and municipal projects, including both renovation and new construction. 

My technical skills have enabled me to create animations of engineering projects as well as company branding, and to teach AutoCAD at the college level. 

I've worked on electrical design for the ConocoPhillips Wood River oil refinery expansion project, valued in excess of $100MM. 

I've also used 3D programs to reconcile gas pipeline data, and I've designed cellular towers for telecom customers such as Cingular, T-Mobile, and Nextel.
