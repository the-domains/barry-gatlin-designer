I've worked on electrical design for the ConocoPhillips Wood River refinery expansion project, valued in excess of $100MM.

Most recently, I've served as Senior Electrical Designer, responsible for lighting and power design for commercial and municipal projects, including both renovation and new construction. I also used my skills in 3D design to create animations of both engineering projects and company branding. 

I have taught AutoCAD at the college level.
